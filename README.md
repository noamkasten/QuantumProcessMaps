## Overview

This project provides a detailed exploration of quantum process maps, focusing on the theoretical and practical aspects of modeling noisy quantum circuits. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the application of these concepts using Python.

## Theory

### Quantum States and Operations

In theory, the state of a quantum system is represented by a density matrix (œÅ), which is a positive semi-definite matrix with trace one. This matrix provides a complete description of the quantum state, including mixed states that can arise from statistical mixtures of different pure states.

Quantum operations describe how quantum states evolve. These operations can include:
- **Unitary transformations**: Ideal, noiseless operations.
- **Non-unitary processes**: Such as noise and decoherence.

These operations, including noisy gates, can be described using quantum channels through Kraus Representation:

\[ E_j (ho) = \sum_i K_i ho K_i^\dagger \]
\[ \sum_i K_i^\dagger K_i = I \]

### Noisy Quantum Circuits

Our approach involves dividing the quantum circuit into different parts, each represented by a channel \( E_j (ho) \) defined with its Kraus operators. This allows us to model the noisy channels as follows:

\[ ho_j = E_j (ho_{j-1}) \]

#### Types of Noise

1. **Regular Noises on States**:
   - Example: Bit-flip on the second qubit:
   
   \[ ho_j = E_j (ho_{j-1}) = (1 - f_j(\{p_i\})) ho_{j-1} + f_j(\{p_i\}) \cdot X_2 ho_{j-1} X_2^\dagger \]
   - Here, \( \{p_i\} \) represents the fault degree of freedom for the i-th regular noise, and \( f_j(\{p_i\}): [0,1] ightarrow [0,1] \) is a function of these parameters.

2. **Noisy Syndrome/Fixing Gates**:
   - For two-qubit gates with an operator \( O_{	ext{original}} \), we replace it with an "unwanted operation" \( O_{	ext{noise}} \) with probability \( g_j(\{q_i\}): [0,1] ightarrow [0,1] \):
   
   \[ ho_j = E_j (ho_{j-1}) = (1 - g_j(\{q_i\})) O_{	ext{original}} ho_{j-1} O_{	ext{original}}^\dagger + g_j(\{q_i\}) \cdot O_{	ext{noise}} ho_{j-1} O_{	ext{noise}}^\dagger \]
   - Example: The unitary action of CNOT:
   
   \[ 	ext{CNOT}_{	ext{control} ightarrow 	ext{target}} = |0angle \langle 0|_{	ext{control}} \otimes I_{	ext{target}} \otimes I_{	ext{rest}} + |1angle \langle 1|_{	ext{control}} \otimes X_{	ext{target}} \otimes I_{	ext{rest}} \]

### Assumptions of Our Model

To simplify our model, we made the following assumptions:
1. **Linear Noises**: \( f_j(\{p_i\}) = p_i \) and \( g_j(\{q_i\}) = q_i \).
2. **Uniform Fault Probability**: \( p_i = p \) and \( q_j = q \) for all \( i, j \).
3. **Simplified Identity Noise Model**: For faulty two-qubit gates, \( O_{	ext{noise}} = I \), meaning the gate essentially does not work.
